# Changelog

Notable changes to sonore. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Until 1.0, a minor version (0.x.0) may change import paths or behaviour; a patch
version (0.x.y) only fixes bugs.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- A starter notebook, `docs/notebooks/start.ipynb`, with an "Open in Colab"
  badge in the README: a first tour that installs sonore from PyPI and runs
  in the browser. `tests/test_notebook.py` runs its code cells.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-01

First release on PyPI.

### Added
- `so.Cepstrum`: the real cepstrum of an `STFT` or `TVSTFT`, with liftering
  (fixed or per-frame cutoff), the cepstral envelope, resynthesis with the
  original or minimum phase, classic cepstral F0, and `plot`. Design and
  numerical checks in `docs/design/cepstrum.md` and
  `tools/check_cepstrum_claims.py`.
- `so.load_hrirs()` downloads the PKU-IOA HRIR database on first use (1 m by
  default, any of its 8 distances on request), checks each file's SHA-256 and
  caches it in `$SONORE_DATA_DIR` or the user cache directory. The SOFA copy it
  downloads is mirrored left to right relative to the original `.dat` files;
  the loader corrects it.
- `HRIRSet.concat` merges HRIR sets, e.g. one per distance.
- Continuous integration: tests and lint on Python 3.10 and 3.14 for every push
  and pull request, plus a check that the PyPI files build and pass their tests.
- Release workflow publishing to TestPyPI and PyPI with trusted publishing
  (see `docs/releasing.md`).
- Gallery pages of their own for seeing speech, a short course in time-frequency
  analysis, and for sound textures. Each is a runnable script
  (`docs/gallery/speech.py`, `docs/gallery/textures.py`) shown with every example's code.

### Changed
- `HRIRSet.from_pku_ioa` also finds `.dat` files in subfolders, so the
  database's own `dist*/elev*/` layout loads directly.
- The source distribution now holds the code, tests and tools only; the docs,
  gallery and audio samples stay in the repository.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-29

Renamed to sonore, with the version kept in one place (`src/sonore/__init__.py`).
Not published to PyPI.
