# Changelog

Notable changes to sonore. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Until 1.0, a minor version (0.x.0) may change import paths or behaviour; a patch
version (0.x.y) only fixes bugs.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Continuous integration: tests and lint on Python 3.10 and 3.14 for every push
  and pull request, plus a check that the PyPI files build and pass their tests.
- Release workflow publishing to TestPyPI and PyPI with trusted publishing
  (see `docs/releasing.md`).
- Gallery pages of their own for seeing speech, a short course in time-frequency
  analysis, and for sound textures. Each is a runnable script
  (`docs/gallery/speech.py`, `docs/gallery/textures.py`) shown with every example's code.

### Changed
- The source distribution now holds the code, tests and tools only; the docs,
  gallery and audio samples stay in the repository.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-29

Renamed to sonore, with the version kept in one place (`src/sonore/__init__.py`).
Not published to PyPI.
